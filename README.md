Deploy on Kubernetes with ArgoCD




## Introduction

Deploy on Kubernetes with Helm/HelmFile and ArgoCD. 




## Usage

Deploy environment
```yaml
  name: Pull Request
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches: [ 'main' ]
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      environment:
        name: preview
        url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.webapp-url }}  
      steps:
        
        - name: Configure AWS Credentials
          uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1.7.0
          with:
            aws-region: us-west-2
            role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/preview
            role-session-name: deploy
      
        - name: Deploy
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-deploy-argocd@main
          id: deploy
          with:
            cluster: https://github.com/cloudposse/argocd-deploy-non-prod-test/blob/main/plat/ue2-sandbox/apps
            toolchain: helmfile
            environment: preview
            namespace: preview
            application: test-app
            github-pat: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_AUTH_PAT }}
            repository: ${{ github.repository }}
            ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref  }}
            image: nginx
            image-tag: latest
            operation: deploy
            debug: false
            synchronously: true
  ```


Destroy environment
```yaml
  name: Pull Request
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches: [ 'main' ]
      types: [closed]

  jobs:
    destroy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Configure AWS Credentials
          uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1.7.0
          with:
            aws-region: us-west-2
            role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/preview
            role-session-name: destroy          
      
        - name: Destroy
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-deploy-helmfile@main
          id: destroy
          with:
            cluster: https://github.com/cloudposse/argocd-deploy-non-prod-test/blob/main/plat/ue2-sandbox/apps
            toolchain: helmfile
            environment: preview
            namespace: preview
            application: test-app
            github-pat: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_AUTH_PAT }}
            repository: ${{ github.repository }}
            ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}  
            image: "<none>"

We use [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) to streamline how Terraform tests are run. It centralizes configuration and wraps common test workflows with easy-to-use commands.

All tests are located in the [`test/`](test) folder.

Under the hood, tests are powered by Terratest together with our internal [Test Helpers](https://github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers) library, providing robust infrastructure validation.

Setup dependencies:
- Install Atmos ([installation guide](https://atmos.tools/install/))
- Install Go [1.24+ or newer](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Install Terraform or OpenTofu

To run tests:

- Run all tests:  
  ```sh
  atmos test run
  ```
- Clean up test artifacts:  
  ```sh
  atmos test clean
  ```
- Explore additional test options:  
  ```sh
  atmos test --help
  ```
The configuration for test commands is centrally managed. To review what's being imported, see the [`atmos.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/atmos/terraform-module.yaml) file.

Learn more about our [automated testing in our documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/community/contribute/automated-testing/) or implementing [custom commands](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/custom-commands/) with atmos.
