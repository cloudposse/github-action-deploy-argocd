## Usage

Deploy environment
```yaml
  name: Pull Request
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches: [ 'main' ]
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      environment:
        name: preview
        url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.webapp-url }}  
      steps:
        
        - name: Configure AWS Credentials
          uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1.7.0
          with:
            aws-region: us-west-2
            role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/preview
